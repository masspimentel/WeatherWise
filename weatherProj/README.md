# Weather Analysis with OpenWeatherAPI

â˜€ðŸŒ¤â˜€

A Python script to retrieve and analyze weather data using OpenWeatherAPI.

## Overview

This Python script allows you to retrieve weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherAPI. It provides daily weather forecasts, including temperature, sunrise/sunset times, moonrise/moonset times, moon phase, precipitation probability, and wind speed. Additionally, it identifies the top temperatures for the forecasted days. 

UPDATE 24/10/2023: I have now added functionaility to retrieve historical weather data (only to 1979 and up to 4 days in the future). Also, ability to convert between lat and lon to readable location with OpenCageAPI.

UPDATE 10/12/2023: Full UI for users and functionality for notifications. Historical Data is unused (for now). More functions will come later but for now its mostly complete. Also, added user authentication. I understand its not needed as it is a local application but it was fun to learn how to implement this.

This is an ongoing project that I will be continually add new functions to. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: requests, json, datetime, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, opencage, time
- OpenWeatherAPI key (sign up at [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/))
- OpenCageAPI key (sign up at [OpenCage](https://opencagedata.com/))
- Twilio API key, Auth. token, and phone number (sign up at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio))

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/masspimentel/beg-project.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
   Run the script: python main.py
   Enter the city name, country code, and the number of API calls as prompted.
2. Download the requirements.txt file
   ```
   pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

## Results
This application is a displays weather info depending on user location (or user input). For now it will show weather cards for each day. I will also display the graphs shown below. The data is stored in a local SQLite DB. 

##To use notification function
1. Create a Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Create an API key, authorization token and obtain your Twilio number
3. Create a config.py class and name the variables accordingly. 
4. Once those are created, you should have the notifications set up.
5. To automate the notifications, you have a plethora of options to choose. From cloud based (AWS, Google Cloud options, Heroku) or local based (Windows Task manager, Linux Cron Jobs). 
   a. I chose to use AWS the setup is relatively simple but I wont go over that here as it is all based on preference.
